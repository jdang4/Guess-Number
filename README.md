# Guess-Number

Overview:
The algorithm I used to figure out a secret 5 digit number. In the worst case scenario, it would take my program 32 guesses to determine the 5 digit number. 

Rules:
- the farmer will give you a number of goats that corresponds to the number of digits that you guessed that are correctly placed in the secret 5 digit number

- the farmer will give you a number of chickens that corresponds to the number of digits that you guessed that are in the secret 5 digit number

How to Run:

ex: "python guessNumber.py fileName.txt"

if want to run the test cases: "python testCases.py"
NOTE: will put a real strain on your machine
